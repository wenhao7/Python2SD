# Python2SD
A drawing canvas that converts your sketch in real time to images generated by StableDiffusion
![demo](https://github.com/wenhao7/Python2SD/blob/main/demo.gif)

## Prerequisite
1. [Stable Diffusion WebUI by AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) with API mode enabled
2. ControlNet extension with [Scribble Model](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1/tree/main)

## Running the script
Once webui is set up with API mode and the required ControlNet model installed, with webui running simply execute App.py and start drawing!

## How it works
The drawing canvas and UI is rendered using tkinter package. When the user is drawing on the canvas, the drawing is encoded and included in a json request payload sent to stablediffusion webui's API where an image is generated and sent back to the script as a response.
